# Add Super Admin Account Switching Feature

## GOAL:
Allow super admins to "switch into" any user account to see their exact view for troubleshooting purposes.

## CURRENT SITUATION:
- Admin panel shows list of all user accounts
- Super admin can only view user data from admin perspective
- Cannot see what users actually experience in their dashboard

## WHAT TO BUILD:

### 1. Add "Switch to Account" Button
- Add button/link in the Account Management table for each user
- Button text: "Login as User" or "Switch to Account"
- Only visible to super admins (not regular admins)

### 2. Account Switching Functionality
**When super admin clicks "Switch to Account":**
- Session switches to that user's account
- Interface completely changes to show that user's view
- Header updates to show user's business name and logo (e.g., "Miner" instead of "Bhriella's Farm")
- All data becomes that user's data:
  - Dashboard shows their analytics
  - Setup shows their business configuration
  - Channels shows their integrations
  - Chat shows their conversations

### 3. Switch Back Feature
- Add "Return to Admin" button/banner when in switched mode
- Clearly indicate current mode (e.g., "Viewing as: Miner Account")
- One-click return to admin dashboard

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Session Management:** Temporarily store original admin session
- **User Profile Switching:** Change active userProfile in session
- **UI Updates:** Dynamic header/business name display
- **Security:** Only super admins can access this feature
- **Navigation:** All existing user features should work normally

## USER EXPERIENCE:
1. Super admin clicks "Login as User" for account #104183046721441373353
2. Interface switches to show "Miner" business view
3. Super admin sees exactly what Miner sees (their dashboard, data, setup)
4. Super admin can troubleshoot issues by experiencing the user's exact interface
5. Super admin clicks "Return to Admin" to switch back

**Purpose:** Enable customer support by letting super admins experience the platform exactly as users do.
