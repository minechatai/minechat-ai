Build Admin Management System - Project Overview
🎯 BIG PICTURE UNDERSTANDING
Current Situation: We have a working customer-facing SaaS platform (Minechat AI) where users can create accounts, set up their businesses, and use AI chat assistants. However, we have ZERO admin tools to manage these users.
Critical Problem: When users experience issues, we cannot:

View their account details
Troubleshoot their problems
Fix broken integrations
Provide customer support
Monitor platform health

What We're Building: A comprehensive admin management system that allows our team to manage all user accounts, troubleshoot issues, and provide customer support.
🏗️ PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
New Admin System Will Include:

Super Admin Dashboard - Overview of all users and system health
User Management Interface - Search, view, and manage individual accounts
Support Tools - Troubleshoot and fix user issues
System Analytics - Platform-wide metrics and monitoring
Admin Authentication - Secure access control for admin team

Database Changes Needed:

Add admin user roles and permissions
Create admin session management
Add admin activity logging

Frontend Changes Needed:

New admin-only routes and pages
Admin navigation and layout
Admin-specific components

🔐 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Admin Access Control:

Only designated admin users can access admin features
Admin routes must be completely separate from user routes
All admin actions must be logged for audit trail
Secure admin session management

User Privacy Protection:

Admin can view user data for support purposes only
No unauthorized access to sensitive user information
Clear separation between admin and user data

🎨 DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Admin Interface Should Be:

Clean and professional (suitable for internal team use)
Fast and efficient (admin users are power users)
Information-dense (lots of data in organized layout)
Action-oriented (quick access to common support tasks)

⚠️ CRITICAL GUIDELINES
IMPORTANT: We will give you ONE task at a time. Please:

Wait for each specific task before starting implementation
Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
Focus only on the current task - don't jump ahead
Ensure each task is complete before moving to the next
Keep existing user functionality intact - don't break current features

✅ View all user accounts and their status
✅ Search and filter users quickly
✅ View detailed user information and settings
